<p>The new year is upon us and itâ€™s really exciting because at this time everyone goes through a little of reflection and write down their goals to achieve during or before the end of 2022. However, only a small percentage of people stick with their goals till the end and the rest seems to focus hard over the first 30 to 60 days before falling back into those old habits.
It is therefore very important to know <strong>what is your why when we set your goals</strong> as they are going to guide us, keep us motivated each day and help us to sustain positive momentum through the ups and downs of life. More importantly, to establish a routine (or process) to support our journey</p>
